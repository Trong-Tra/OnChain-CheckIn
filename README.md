## About the projects
Our smart contract, currently under development, is designed to facilitate on-chain check-ins, serving as a tool to monitor user loyalty and engagement with a program or project. This contract aims to assist large projects in tracking their blockchain activity efficiently. By recording user check-ins, it helps in assessing and rewarding user consistency, making it an essential utility for airdrop allocation and other loyalty-based rewards. This innovation not only ensures transparency and accountability but also strengthens the bond between projects and their communities, fostering long-term engagement and support.
